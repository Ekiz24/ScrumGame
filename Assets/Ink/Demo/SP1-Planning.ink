Congrats, now you'll officially be in Sprint 1 while you're in Concept Stage, which means we don't really need to start getting our hands on a digital game prototype just yet.#C:Squirrel:0
let's talk about Sprint Planning! It's a meeting at the beginning of the Sprint where the team discusses.#C:Squirrel:0
Your dev team needs a clear prioritization of tasks before they actually start developing.#C:Squirrel:0
So, your current mission is to classify 9 pre-selected tasks into High, Medium, and Low priority - 3 tasks per category.#C:Squirrel:0
Remember, High-priority items directly impact player experience and how the game runs. Medium supports more features. Low is nice-to-have.#C:Squirrel:0
Understood.#C:Dog:0
Perfect! Drag tasks to the priority columns. Watch out for tricky requirements that seem unimportant but aren't!#C:Squirrel:0
