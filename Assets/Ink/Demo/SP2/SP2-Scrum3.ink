=FocusCheck
Prioritizing core gameplay UX. Any issues observed? #C:Dog:0
->VisualUpdates

=VisualUpdates
UI animations require 3 more days for proper implementation. The current timeline is unrealistic. #C:Peacock:0
We must lock technical specifications today. Further delays will compromise the entire sprint. #C:Cat:0
Let's practice active listening. Peacock first: What essential element needs protection? #C:Dog:0
->ActiveListening_Explanation

=ActiveListening_Explanation
Active listening means restating concerns to ensure mutual understanding. Three components: 
1. Paraphrasing content
2. Identifying emotions 
3. Asking clarifying questions
Now try restating Cat's position, Peacock. #C:Dog:0
->ConflictResolution1

=ConflictResolution1
(paraphrasing) You're worried delayed animations will push back QA cycles... #C:Peacock:0
Yes, we need 48h for regression testing before launch. #C:Cat:0
->Compromise

=Compromise
Proposal: Tiered implementation. Core UI today, secondary animations in v1.1 patch. #C:Dog:0
Acceptable if we document deferred assets clearly. #C:Peacock:0
Agreed. I'll create the technical debt tracker. #C:Cat:0
->AudioAdjustments

=AudioAdjustments
Music adjustments conflict with balance testing priorities. Numerical tuning must take precedence. #C:Fox:0
Emotional resonance through audio is equally vital for player retention. #C:Lark:0
->ABC_Explanation

=ABC_Explanation
Let's apply Ellis's ABC model:
A - Activating Event (surface conflict)
B - Beliefs (underlying assumptions) 
C - Consequences (emotional/behavioral outcomes)
Fox, identify the 'A' in this situation. #C:Dog:0
->ABC_Application

=ABC_Application
A: Audio changes requiring rebalancing. #C:Fox:0
Lark's B: "Emotion drives retention" vs Fox's B: "Numbers ensure fairness" #C:Dog:0
Consequence: Mutual frustration. Now seek cognitive restructuring. #C:Dog:0
->Reframe

=Reframe
Shared goal: Engagement through balanced emotional/numerical design. #C:Dog:0
Solution: Dynamic music scaling with achievement thresholds. #C:Dog:0
->Synergy

=Synergy
I can map BPM changes to XP gain rates. Technical feasible? #C:Lark:0
Yes, using existing progression APIs. Requires 18h implementation. #C:Cat:0
This preserves balance while adding emotional depth. Approved. #C:Fox:0
->TechStability

=TechStability
System optimizations completed. Audio-Progress API integration passed stress tests. #C:Cat:0
->BalanceTuning

=BalanceTuning
Adjusted values account for new audio dynamics. Testing thresholds updated. #C:Fox:0
->NarrativeIntegration

=NarrativeIntegration
Branching paths now reflect both statistical outcomes and emotional tones. #C:Deer:0
->Debugging

=Debugging
Latency reduced 60% through coordinated debugging sessions. All systems nominal. #C:Capybara:0
