=PhaseStart
Team, we're entering Sprint 2, and in Pre-Production stage. Our goal is a playable prototype with core features. #C:Dog:0
Remember the client's feedback - a digital prototype that can be actually interacted with. #C:Dog:0

=TaskClarification
Digital version? My workload just tripled this week. What exactly needs implementation? #C:Cat:0
Also, Fox's gameplay documentation still has some unclear parts for me. #C:Cat:0
Don't worry, I'll provide detailed mechanic specifications by tomorrow morning. #C:Fox:0
I'm still uncertain about my specific tasks too. #C:Deer:0

That's why we do Sprint Planning - to clarify objectives and divide responsibilities. #C:Dog:0
Core features first: how to run the restaurant. it's a management game after all. #C:Dog:0
And recipe development - the client specifically emphasized that. #C:Deer:0
Exactly. With both features implemented, we'll have minimum viable gameplay. #C:Dog:0
->CriticalReminder

=CriticalReminder
You're forgetting something crucial. #C:Cat:0
What? #C:Dog:0
How can it be "interacted" without interaction? Basic UI and UX matter. #C:Cat:0
Good catch! That's priority zero. Let's build the Sprint Backlog now - maximum 3 tasks this sprint. #C:Dog:0
