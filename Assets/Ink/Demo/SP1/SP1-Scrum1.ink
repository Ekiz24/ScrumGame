It was pure chaos! I was archiving old sketches. Then, the mug tipped over my workstation! #C:Peacock:0
In the panic, some design documents slid into the shredder tray. #C:Peacock:0
*You hit the button?#C:Dog:0

*No emergency stop?#C:Dog:0

The machine auto-starts when papers reach sensors! I was wrestling with the shredder. #C:Peacock:0
